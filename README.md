# MovieDatabase

### Introduction
MovieDatabase is an application designed for retrieving, storing, updating, and filtering information about movies, TV shows, and celebrities.
Leveraging the OMDb API for data retrieval and MySQL for local data storage, it offers a comprehensive solution for managing entertainment content.

### Motivation
The development of MovieDatabase was motivated by the desire to explore Entity Framework Core 7.0 and implement various features necessary for a robust movie database system.

### Key Features
1. Information Retrieval: Retrieve data from the OMDb API and store it locally in the MySQL database.
2. Information Management: Query, update, delete, and manage nested data such as actors linked to movies.
3. Data Creation: Add new movies and actors to the database.
4. Filtering & Sorting: Easily filter and sort data by properties like Rating, Duration, Release Year, and more, making data navigation efficient even as the database grows.

### 1. Dashboard
